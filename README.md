## More about our project
### General Approach
While looking for an exciting project to work on, both of us came across apps that play instruments. 
Mitch chanced upon an [article] (https://medium.com/open-graphql/building-a-real-time-collaborative-beatbox-with-react-graphql-96246e9fed80) that led us to the [hooks-drum-machine repo] (https://github.com/kenwheeler/hooks-drum-machine). Seeing that it was using the React which we were familiar with and the idea of working on a step sequencer sounds interesting, we decided to take the project further by adding a MongoDB + Express.js + Node.js backend so that one can not only play it, but save, replay and edit!

We started with deciding the scope of our project, filtering what was MVP and what were additional feature -> User Journey -> Wireframe -> Delegation & Timeline.

The feature which we will be adding in this version of BeatIT! (ver 1) are:
**User-Related**
  - Add Account
  - Edit Account
  - Change Password
  - Beat Sequence created are private (only creator can see it)
  
**Beat Sequencer-Related**
  - Save
  - Clear Row, clear Grid
  - Hear the sound of instrument on click
  - Change the name of the beat sequence

### Major Hurdles
1.  Having to go back to the bare minimum MongoDB Schema
- We initially planned our schema to emcompass the future additional features that we wanted to have (user can add, upload, remove instruments & soundtrack). However, 2 days into our 5-day project timeline, we found it hard to fit our planned schema into the way the original hook-drum-machine was coded (foresee numerous data manipulation). Considering the time limitation, we decided to drop our planned schema and adapt the schema to how the original repo was coded.

2. User Authorisation and Authentication 
- We faced the issue of page refreshing every time we click on a route in the Navbar. This cause the logged in users to be logged out with every page toggle or refresh.
We finally found the reason why - using Nav.Link from react-bootstap, which was different from Link to in react-router-dom. 

3. <More to come>
    
### Future Addition Features
- [ ] Add/ Upload/ Remove instruments & soundtracks, even your own!
- [ ] Re-order the the instrument rows
- [ ] Add grid to make it a 2-, 3-grid sequence
= [ ] Share beat sequence created to everyone (a public listing page)
- [ ] Drum Kit (user-friendly buttons to play the drums, without a sequencer)

## Installation Instructions
 - git clone, npm install (root folder as well as client-react folder)
 - Note: replace line 241-250 of the node_module react-cache/cjs/react-cache.development.js 
```javascript
// var currentOwner = React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED.ReactCurrentOwner;
// function readContext(Context, observedBits) {
//   var dispatcher = currentOwner.currentDispatcher;
//   if (dispatcher === null) {
//     throw new Error('react-cache: read and preload may only be called from within a ' + "component's render. They are not supported in event handlers or " + 'lifecycle methods.');
//   }
//   return dispatcher.readContext(Context, observedBits);
// }
    const ReactCurrentDispatcher =
      React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED
        .ReactCurrentDispatcher;
    function readContext(Context, observedBits) {
      const dispatcher = ReactCurrentDispatcher.current;
      if (dispatcher === null) {
        throw new Error(
          'react-cache: read and preload may only be called from within a ' +
          "component's render. They are not supported in event handlers or " +
          'lifecycle methods.',
        );
      }
      return dispatcher.readContext(Context, observedBits);
    }
```
- after which, you can npm run start
